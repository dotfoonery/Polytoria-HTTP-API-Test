# PolyAPI
A proof of concept project to access an API / restAPI through Polytoria, opening a bunch of doors to some stupidly idiotic stuff.

## What this is
This thing just basically has a bunch of information to request, like 2+2, but maybe I could repurpose this (DOD REFERENCE??!?!?) into something so stupidly insane that breaks what is possible for a tech demo
