# Polytoria GET Requests DEMO (API Part)
A proof of concept project to access an API / restAPI through Polytoria, that hosts game neccesities like game information. Relatively simple.


## What this repo hosts
This thing just basically hosts the code to a deployed link that hosts a bunch of game information to request, for example, info to answer "What is this game".
