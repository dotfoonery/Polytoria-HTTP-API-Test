# Polytoria GET Requests DEMO
A proof of concept project to access an API / restAPI through Polytoria, that hosts game neccesities like game information. Relatively simple.


## What this monorepo hosts
This thing just basically hosts the code to a deployed link that hosts a bunch of game information to request, and the lua to actually request it.

## Testing it out 
You can
1. Build it yourself
2. Test it out on [MY PLACE]
