# Polytoria HTTP API Test
A proof of concept project to access an API / restAPI through Polytoria, relatively simple but maybe I could repurpose this (DOD REFERENCE??!?!?) into something so stupidly insane that breaks what is possible for a tech demo.


## What this repo hosts
This thing just basically hosts the code to a deployed link that hosts a bunch of information to request, like 2+2. Then, in my HTTP Fetch Place, you can [insert the functionality here].
Example of the HTTP Fetch running:
- [VID]
