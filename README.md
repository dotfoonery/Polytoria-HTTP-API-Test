# Polytoria GET Requests DEMO
A proof of concept project to access an API / restAPI through Polytoria, that hosts game neccesities like game information. Relatively simple.


## What this repo hosts
This thing just basically hosts the code to a deployed link that hosts a bunch of game information to request. Then, in my Polytoria GET Requests Place, you can [insert the functionality here].
Example of the HTTP Fetch running:
- [VID]
